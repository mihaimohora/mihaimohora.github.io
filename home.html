			<h2> Ronnie "The Rocket" O'Sullivan </h2>
			<p> <b>Ronald Antonio O'Sullivan</b> is an English professional snooker player, and one of 
				the most successful players in the 
				sport's modern era. Regarded by many commentators as the most naturally gifted
				player in snooker history, and frequently described as a genius, he is 
				also noted for his mercurial temperament and for his ambivalent relationship 
				with the sport, from which he has taken prolonged sabbaticals and repeatedly 
				threatened to retire.
			</p>
			
			<p> He is considered by many to be the most naturally talented player in the 
			history of the sport,with some labelling him a 'genius'. Several of his peers 
			regard him as the greatest player ever, although a temperamental streak sometimes
			leads to a lack of confidence or interest, and he has performed inconsistently 
			throughout his controversial career thus far, with observers noting the
			'two Ronnies' aspect of his character.
			</p>

			I've never been so emotionally ingrained in something - in a person, an object, 
			anything - as I have in snooker. </q>
