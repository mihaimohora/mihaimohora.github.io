			<h2> The 1996 World Championship </h2>
			<p> O'Sullivan plays in a fast and attacking manner. He is a prolific 
			breakbuilder and solid tactical player. He has stated his disdain 
			for long, drawn-out games, saying that it harms the game of snooker. 
			He is regarded as an excellent front-runner; by many other professionals.
			In previous years, he could become demoralized by being behind and not 
			playing well, and was liable to lose several consecutive frames. He is 
			right-handed but can play to a very high standard with his left hand and 
			routinely alternates where needed. While not quite possessing the same 
			power in his left arm, being ambidextrous enables him to attempt shots 
			with his left hand that would otherwise require awkward cueing with a 
			rest or spider.
			</p>
					
			<p> When he first displayed this left-handed ability in the 1996 World Championship 
			against Alain Robidoux, the Canadian accused him of disrespect. O'Sullivan responded 
			that he played better with his left hand than Robidoux could with his right.He was 
			summoned to a disciplinary hearing in response to Robidoux's formal complaint, where 
			he had to prove that he could play to a high level with his left hand. He played three 
			frames of snooker against former world championship runner-up Rex Williams, winning all 
			three. The charge of bringing the game into disrepute was subsequently dropped.

			<h2> The 2006 UK Championship </h2>
			<p>In December 2006, in his quarter-final match of the UK Championship 
			against Hendry, O'Sullivan conceded in dramatic fashion part-way into 
			the sixth frame of the best of 17 match. O'Sullivan was leading 24-0 in 
			the sixth frame when he threw in the towel, shaking hands with Hendry 
			and referee Jan Verhaas before leaving the arena, to the amazement of 
			spectators. O'Sullivan issued a statement later that day, apologising 
			and saying that he would be "back on his feet fighting stronger and 
			harder than ever very soon." On 31 May 2007, World Snooker fined 
			him a total of &#8356;20,800 over this incident, and docked him 900 ranking 
			points.

			<h2> The 2010 World Open </h2>
			<p> At the World Open O'Sullivan made his record 10th maximum break 
			in the last frame of his match against Mark King, which he won 3-0. 
			However, he had to be persuaded by referee Jan Verhaas to play the final 
			black, as he had become aware that there was no distinct prize money for 
			a maximum break in the tournament, but only a prize of &#8356;4,000 for the 
			highest break. Even then, he played the final black in a nonchalant 
			fashion.

			<h2> The 2016 Welsh Open </h2>
			<p> O'Sullivan asked officials what the rolling prize had reached for 
			this week's Welsh Open when leading Barry Pinches 3-1.
			And when told it was just &#8356;10,000 three-time event winner O'Sullivan,
			40, deliberately played for the pink off the 14th red.
			He then completed a brilliant 146 break at the Motorpoint Arena - 
			taking the black again off the final red to close out a 4-1 victory.
			O'Sullivan said: <q>I could have got on the black off that red, 
			and possibly got another 147. You never know, it can get twitchy.
			But &#8356;10,000 - it's too cheap! It is a massive achievement getting 
			a 147 and it is worth more than that. Once it goes up I'll give it 
			another go.</q>
